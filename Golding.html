                <h3>The sheriff put me on Central Park duty today. He keeps assigning me to patrol the park. I never get any action there. UGH. The reason I took this job was to be at crime scenes during all hours of the day. I’m not like other police officers who would rather sit around all day, I want to be catching criminals. I guess I’ll go about my regular Central Park patrol routine. I drove loops around the park waiting to see some criminal activity.
